# Microarray Practice with GEO Dataset of ncbi

Here outer side of this folder have basics of the imageprocessing but this is not sufficent for implimenting the real one using geo data.
I tried but and still didn't get any right way to impiment or find the best test result from gean sets.

But I got some tutorials which might help some to find the way or if in future I'll find anything else will sure to update it on this folder.

## Few Tutorials which I'm sharing here
